# IOBots

A game *(well not yet)* heavily inspired by [Much Assembly Required](https://github.com/simon987/Much-Assembly-Required)

As of now, this project is just an assembler and emulator for my custom 8086-like processor the bots will use.

Check out [the wiki]() to see what there is so far!

### The premise

You have a robot that spawns in a world with resources in it. You can control it manually, or you can program it in assembly to do your bidding for you. You can make more robots, and program them too. Soon enough, you'll have an army of robots that program themselves.
